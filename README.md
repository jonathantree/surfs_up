# Surfing Up Ice Cream on Oahu

## Project Overview:

This project focuses on revealing weather trends on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. These data will be used to convinve potential investors of the potential of an ice cream and surf shop start up (hypothetical). The investors would like to be convinced that the weather data supports the business model. To add support for this idea using data, exploratory data analysis was conducted using weather staion data. These data contain information of the weather station location, name, precipitation and temperature. Specifically, this project aimed to look at seasonal trends of the precipitaiton and temperature data during the winter month of December and the Summer month of June from 2010 to 2018. Descriptive statistics of the weather from these months will determine the sustainability of this shop year-round. In addition to the statistical analysis, special consideration was paid to understanding the location of weather stations, how this may influence our analysis and further considerations for future planning.
